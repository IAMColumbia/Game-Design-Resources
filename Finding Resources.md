## Tips for Finding Quality Resources

- One general tip in looking for any assets - whether it's 3D models, UI elements or audio - try to find an asset pack. Kenney (link below) is a wonderful resource for that. You can also search for things like "modular" or "asset pack" when looking on game art sites or the asset store. This will help give you a coherent set of assets to work with, instead of stringing together a series of disparate parts.
