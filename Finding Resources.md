## Giving Credit

TODO: importance of checking licenses, giving credit and appropriate ways to give credit
- [Understanding Licenses, or, “Can I Use This Asset In My Game?”](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-licenses-or-can-i-use-this-asset-in-my-game--cms-22510)
- ["Where am I obligated to put credits?"](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/108447) - follow the rules laid out in each asset's license and check out [the IGDA crediting standards](https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/igda-website/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/21170013/IGDA_Game_Crediting_Guide_Draft_9-2-EN-2014.pdf).

## Tips for Finding Quality Resources

- One general tip in looking for any assets - whether it's 3D models, UI elements or audio - try to find an asset pack. [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/assets) is a wonderful resource for that. You can also search for things like "modular" or "asset pack" when looking on game art sites or the asset store. This will help give you a coherent set of assets to work with, instead of stringing together a series of disparate parts.
