Contributions to any of the resources are welcome. You can suggest a change to any file but simply clicking on the specific file within GitHub and then clicking the edit button - see [guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository).

The resources are written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language, that is great for embedding code snippets. Here are a couple references for learning Markdown:

- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) - 3 minute read that explains the syntax.
- [Interactive Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) - an interactive tutorial that walks you through writting markdown.
